Would it show that I don’t know enough? Or, would my list be long and brutal compared to hers? The later thought being quite ironic, as if I would see more hearing privilege than she would.</p> <p>When we finally did exchange lists, there were many similarities.  I realized that the honest risk-taking is what allowed me to understand and learn more.  Writing a list of hearing privileges and reflecting independently was a meaningful exercise for me as a hearing person, but sharing my list with a Deaf person was a different thing entirely.  I think it’s an important form of accountability and a great opportunity to understand these issues more deeply.  Just knowing I was going to share my list with Alison pushed me to be more critical and I am grateful to her for this. <h6>Alison:</h6> It has been a challenge to phrase statements so that the “privilege” is reflective of a system that favors or gives advantages to hearing people as opposed to presenting the “deaf can’t- and therefore should prefer to become hearing” perspective, where we once again demonize the individual. And that is yet another privilege that hearing people have—that the system comes with that ready-made frame that gives preference to the state of being hearing, that the ideology is so prevalent and so pervasive that it is difficult to present the truth that Deaf beings are living within a system that constantly invalidates their existence without people jumping to the pathological idea that a simple way to “fix” barriers would be to make Deaf people hearing. It is hearing privilege that jumping to this idea is acceptable, that no one expresses concern that “fixing” is equivalent to destroying the Deaf being. And it is hearing privilege that the idea of “fixing” is “the norm,” “benevolent,” “acceptable,” “neutral,” while the idea that this is in actuality a destructive approach is considered “radical,” “militant,” “hurtful.”</p> <p>Taking this journey with Erin has been both humbling and validating. To watch someone so openly wrestle with her privilege inspires me to also work through mine. And it is a form of love that she would endeavor to stand with me, with us this way. Even in the safety of our dialogue I on occasion catch myself wanting to be gentler, which in itself can be a form of deference to the privileged. Erin does not reach for that refuge where too many of us seek to hide from the rawness of introspection. She instead continues to push herself and owns every action, every word. And that in itself is a refusal to hold onto power, a parallel process to the very article we are collaborating on. <h3>Statements of Hearing Privilege</h3> The statements below refer to privileges that we feel a person has on the merit of their hearing status alone. We do recognize that there are intersections present and that there are some privileges listed below that are specific to members of the English speaking community (in America).
